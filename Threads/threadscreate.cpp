---------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“Œ Notes:

1. `thread t1(thread_fun)` â†’ creates a new thread executing `thread_fun`.
2. `t1.join()` â†’ main process waits until thread finishes.
3. `t1.detach()` â†’ would allow thread to run independently (main doesn't wait).
4. `sleep(1)` â†’ simulates processing time, helps visualize thread execution.

5. Output behavior:
   - Thread prints numbers 0-4 with delays.
   - After thread finishes, main prints numbers 15-19 with delays.

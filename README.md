Topic: Improved Range Selection in the Bisection Method
What could be the better approach to choose the range in the bisection method?
In the bisection method, the accuracy and efficiency of root-finding depend significantly on the initial interval ([a, b]), where the function ( f(x) ) is continuous and satisfies the condition f(a) . f(b) < 0 . This ensures that a root exists within the interval, based on the Intermediate Value Theorem.

A better approach to selecting this range includes:

Automated Interval Scanning:
Instead of manually guessing values for ([a, b]), it is more reliable to scan a broader domain programmatically to detect a sign change in the function. This method ensures that the interval is valid and contains a root.

Example in C++ (conceptual snippet):

for (double x = lowerBound; x < upperBound; x += stepSize) {
    if (f(x) * f(x + stepSize) < 0) {
        a = x;
        b = x + stepSize;
        break;
    }
}
This loop checks consecutive points within a specified domain to identify a sign change, automatically determining a suitable interval.

Graphical Analysis: When feasible, plotting 𝑓(𝑥) over a wide range can visually reveal intervals where the function crosses the x-axis, helping to choose appropriate bounds.

This technique enhances the reliability of the bisection method and is particularly useful when the root's location is not known in advance.
